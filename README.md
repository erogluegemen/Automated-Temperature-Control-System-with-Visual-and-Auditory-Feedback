# Automated-Temperature-Control-System-with-Visual-and-Auditory-Feedback
The objective of this project is to create a temperature control system using an Arduino microcontroller that regulates a fan motor's speed based on the ambient temperature. Additionally, the system provides visual feedback using an RGB LED and auditory feedback using a buzzer.
